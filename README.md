- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **CSS Variables** - Theming
- **Clerk** - Authentication
- **Axios** - API requests
- **React Icons** - Icon library

### Backend
- **PHP 7.4+** - Server-side logic
- **MySQL/MariaDB** - Database
- **PDO** - Database access layer
- **JWT** - Token authentication
- **REST API** - Backend architecture

## üìã Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4+ with PDO extension
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.2+
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account (for authentication)

## üöÄ Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-platform.git
   cd blog-platform
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp config/env.example.php config/env.php
   ```
   Edit `env.php` with your database credentials and Clerk API keys.

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   php scripts/setup_database.php
   ```
   Alternatively, import the `blog_platform.sql` file into your MySQL database.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   php scripts/start_server.php
   ```
   The backend server will run at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Edit `.env.local` with your Clerk publishable key and API URL.

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use)

## üíª Development

### Frontend Development with Mock Data

The frontend is configured to work with mock data when the backend is not available or during development:

1. Mock data is enabled by default in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
2. The system includes sample posts, categories, and users
3. All API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are simulated
4. To use real backend data, set `USE_MOCK_DATA = false` in the API service

### Authentication Development Mode

For easier development without requiring Clerk authentication:

1. The system includes a development bypass for authentication
2. Enable dev mode in the configuration to skip Clerk verification
3. The dev mode provides a mock login interface for testing
4. **Important:** Always disable dev mode in production

## üîí Authentication

This project uses Clerk for authentication. Refer to [CLERK_SETUP.md](CLERK_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions, including:

- Creating a Clerk account
- Setting up API keys
- Configuring JWT verification
- Securing backend endpoints
- Troubleshooting authentication issues
